Report Your Expenses

My wife uses her iPhone notes app to keep track of our expenses.
They just keep piling up and we never do anything about it
so we figured we need something a little more effective.

I built the skeleton using GAE, then figured we could make it
look actually nice using Bootstrap. So a bit of tweaking and we
have a nice app to keep track of our expenses.
